# Multi-Stage-Amplifier-Design

Designed a single-supply, multistage inverting transistor amplifier that met specifications for voltage gain, output swing, and frequency response using BJTs in CC-CE-CC configuration. The circuit was simulated and analyzed in Multisim using DC and AC analysis, achieving a no-load voltage gain of 50 V/V and successful operation within a frequency range of 20 Hz to 50 kHz. The amplifier's performance was tested under different load conditions, ensuring minimal distortion and accurate frequency response using Bode plots and waveform analysis. Upon generation, the results were confirmed through the created waveforms.
